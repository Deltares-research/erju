# Rail4Earth - Subtask 3.3.3: Analysing technics with optical fibre networks

## Project Description

This project explores the potential to use dark fibres in the rail network, which can be turned into a seismic array of sensors to detect railway vibrations. The main objectives of this project are:
- Assess the accuracy and reliability of vibration measurements by fibre optics
- Develop a pipeline for the collection, transmission, processing and storing of fibre optics data
- Develop a machine learning algorithm to establish the relation between the railway induced vibration measured by the fibre optics and the railway induced vibration at a distance.

## Installation

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies that need to be installed.

## Usage

For now, it's a very simple project. You just need to define the path to the iDas data and run the `test_run.py` script. However, it will get more complex in the future.

## Known Issues

This project is currently in development, so there may be some issues or limitations.
