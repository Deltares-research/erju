# Rail4Earth - Subtask 3.3.3: Analysing technics with optical fibre networks

## Project Description

This project explores the potential to use dark fibres in the rail network, which can be turned into a seismic array of sensors to detect railway vibrations. The main objectives of this project are:
- Assess the accuracy and reliability of vibration measurements by fibre optics
- Develop a pipeline for the collection, transmission, processing and storing of fibre optics data
- Develop a machine learning algorithm to establish the relation between the railway induced vibration measured by the fibre optics and the railway induced vibration at a distance.

## Installation

Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies that need to be installed.

## Usage

The logic behind the project structure is as follows:
- The `erju` folder contains the main scripts and functions that are used to process the data.
- The `other_scrips` folder contains scripts from past project related to processing of fibre optics and accelerometer data.
- The `utils` folder contains utilities that are used repeatedly in the project.
- The `tests` folder contains tests for the functions in the `erju` folder and work in progress scripts to generate results.

## Data

Data related to this project is not included in the repository due to its size.
The raw fibre optics data is stored in external drives. The single event vibrations per sensor will be converted into
netcdf files and stored in the N-drive (to be done).

## Known Issues

This project is currently in development, so there may be some issues or limitations.
